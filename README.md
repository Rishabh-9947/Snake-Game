# Snake-Game
 This classic game is a great way to learn more about game development in Python. You'll be using the Pygame library, which is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games. The library allows for the creation of games with functions to draw images, play sounds, handle different game states, and manage user input.
# Snake Game

Embark on a nostalgic journey with this Python rendition of the classic Snake Game. Built with the Pygame library, this project offers a delightful twist on the timeless arcade game. Guide the snake to consume food, grow in length, and achieve a high score, all while enjoying a modernized version with a Pac-Man-inspired eating animation and a seamless wrap-around screen effect.

## Features

- **Classic Gameplay**: Direct the snake around the game area to consume food and grow in size.
- **Pac-Man Style Eating Animation**: Watch the snake's head animate like Pac-Man as it eats.
- **Wrap-Around Screen Effect**: The snake can traverse off one edge of the screen and reappear on the opposite side, adding a layer of strategy to the game.
- **Scoreboard Display**: Keep track of your score with a real-time scoreboard displayed in the top corner of the game window.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You'll also need the Pygame library, which can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame

Controls:
Use the arrow keys (↑, ↓, ←, →) to control the snake's direction.
Navigate the snake to the food items to increase your score.
Avoid colliding with the snake's own body.

Customization
Feel free to tweak the game settings, such as the snake's speed, window size, or even add new features like different levels or power-ups to enhance the gameplay experience.
